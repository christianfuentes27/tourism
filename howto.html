            <h4>How to get<br><span>to Australia</span></h4>
        </div>

        <div class="howto-container">
            <p>The most common way, and in most cases the only possible way, to get to Australia is by plane. This is
                due to the great distance that separates it from almost all destinations in the world. Currently
                Australia is growing a lot as a tourist place, which has caused an increase in competition and therefore
                a drop in the price of flights.
                <br><br>
                If we want to fly to Australia from Europe, we have offers to make the flight from almost all the
                capitals, but generally with a first stopover in London, Paris or Frankfurt and perhaps another in
                Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan or Dubai.
                <br><br>
                British Airways, Iberia, Alitalia, Qantas, Air France, Lufthansa... all offer flights from Europe to
                Australia for around €1000 round trip. The season to buy the cheapest tickets is, in general, from the
                end of Easter to the beginning of July, when it is winter in this part of the world.
                <br><br>
                Arm yourself with patience because a Madrid Australia journey involves about 23 hours of flight, apart
                from the time you spend at the airports due to layovers.

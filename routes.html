            <h4>Experience of<br><span>traveling</span></h4>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-container">
            <p>Although we encounter many cultural differences in our travels, it is actually incredible how similar we
                are to people who live across the globe. Despite our diverse cultural backgrounds and daily lifestyles,
                travel allows us to connect with others and realize that we actually have a lot in common with that one
                friend living in Sweden. We also enjoy spending time with family, listening to indie pop music, and
                dancing on the weekends.
                <br>
                Once we’ve pulled ourselves outside of the safe, protective bubble of home, we can clearly see that we
                are just like those people hundreds of miles away. We are all a part of a bigger story; we all have more
                bringing us together than tearing us apart. It’s this realization that breaks down fear and prejudices,
                making the world a much smaller, more welcoming, and connected place.
            </p>
            <div class="experience-img"></div>
            <p>Traveling helps us feel like our best self because we are more willing to receive the world’s many
                lessons, no matter their shape or size. It helps us recognize our shared humanity with others and
                dissipates fear or misunderstandings. After all, it’s much more fun to love the world than to be afraid
                of it.
                <br>
                In travel, we find the best in ourselves and in others. We become the person that we had hoped we would
                become as a child: an explorer, open to meeting new people, and learning new things. And maybe, just
                maybe, someone who is brave enough to eat scorpions off a stick.

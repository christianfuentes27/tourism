                Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. It is a
                megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in
                the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east.
                Discover this country, with the most wildlife and nature in the world. Enjoy all types of biomes, from
                deserts like Gibson or Tanami, mountains like Mount Kosciuszko or beaches like Whiteheaven. Australia
                has more than 10,000 beaches, all natural paradises that can be enjoyed by both surfers and families. In
                addition to this, you cannot miss visiting cities like Sydney, Canberra or Melbourne, which are
                flagships of the country.

            <h4>First Nations Australian Origins</h4>
            <p>Indigenous Australians have lived in the nation for at least 50,000 years. This means they have the
                oldest living cultural history in the world. When the British arrived in 1788, as many as 250
                different
                languages were spoken across the nation. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
                Islander Studies has produced this map detailing the languages used across Australia. Barani, an
                Aboriginal word of the Sydney language that means ‘yesterday’, is a project detailing the Aboriginal
                history of the Sydney area.</p>

                        Britain in 1770. The First Fleet of 11 boats arrived at Botany Bay in 1788 to establish New
                        South Wales as a penal colony (receiving convicts until 1848). Convicts were later sent to
                        the
                        other states, with the exception of South Australia, which was established as a free colony
                        in
                        1836.
                        <br>
                        Over 162,000 convicts were transported to Australia from Great Britain, the majority to New

            <h4>1901 - Federation</h4>
            <p>The Commonwealth of Australia was created in 1901 with the Federation of all the states. It was
                agreed
                that the capital could be in NSW but no closer than 100 kilometres from Sydney. This led to the
                creation
                of Canberra, with a temporary parliament set up in Melbourne for 27 years.
                <br>
                Both New Zealand and Fiji were invited to join the Federation of the states but declined the
                invitations.

                    <p>In April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Anzac Corps (ANZACs) took part in the World War
                        I
                        Gallipoli Campaign. Despite the defeat, this battle has great relevance in defining the
                        characteristics of Australians. April 25, the date of the first landing at Gallipoli, is
                        ANZAC
                        Day - the date Australians remember and pay respects for the sacrifice of our Armed Forces,
                        both
                        past and present, in conflicts around the world.

                        Almost 39% of Australia’s male population between 18 and 44 enlisted to fight in World War

                    <p>The end of World War II, and then subsequently the Vietnam War, led to an influx of migrants
                        to
                        Australia. The Snowy Mountains Scheme (1949 - 1974) employed 100,000 people, with 70% being
                        migrants from 30 different nations. Steady Asian migration began in the 1970s, and now
                        people
                        from all over the world call Australia home. This is reflected in many aspects of Australian
                        life, with Australian society known for its equality and lack of clear class distinctions.
